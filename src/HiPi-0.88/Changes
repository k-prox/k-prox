              - HiPi::BCM2835::I2C now supports per-instance transfer rates
              - hipi-i2c utility extended to support en/disable of i2c buses

                value to always be set regardless of peripheral specified.
              - Added i2c_write_error / bus_write_error to allow case where
                i2c error condition expected. e.g. when a device has a
                sofware reset and does not complete the i2c transaction
                when reset command is sent.
              - Standardised error handling across all three i2c interfaces.
              - HiPi::Interface::MPL3115A2 gains mode, active, oversample
                and now uses delay based on oversample rate.

              - All calls to external programs ( cat, echo etc. ) are now
                taint safe.
              - Installation now always does an apt-get update before 
                apt-get install (depedency list). My test builds
                often fail at dependency installation time if apt-get update
                is not executed.
